# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking two degrees in Marketing, Commercial Law and Global Politics and Human Rights
- I am taking STATS 220 because I want to diversify my capabilities beyond the social sciences and marketing.
- I am interested in learning about programming languages and statistical analysis software.
