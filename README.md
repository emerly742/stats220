# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

## A little about me:

- I am undertaking two degrees:
  1. Bachelor of Commerce majoring in Marketing and Commercial Law
  2. Bachelor of Global Studies majoring in French Global Politics and Humans Rights
- I am taking STATS 220 outside of my regular programmes because I want to diversify my capabilities beyond the social sciences and marketing. I'm a bit nervous because I've only done STATS 108 and that was 3 years ago. But I'm ready to learn!
- I want to do market research after university so I'm taking more stats courses so I can work for companies like:

  - [Saatchi & Saatchi](https://www.saatchi.co.nz/)
  - [TRA](https://www.theresearchagency.com/)
  - [DDB](https://www.ddbgroup.co.nz/ddb)

### I am excited to learn the following things in STATS 220
1. How to use programming language R
2. How to *effectively* visualise data
3. Building on my **very** limited programming and statistical experience to become more confident in this area.


A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies (in my fifth and *hopefully* final year) is
