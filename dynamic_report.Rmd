## What on earth are you watching? Good question. Here's some data about YouTube video watching habits.

The following data, presented as tables and summary values, represent video watching habits over several days. It examines and correlates multiple variables including video completion, enjoyment, duration and views.

```{r}

# uploading and naming the .csv file
csv_file <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQmWSFZzxWK9716TRkVamqK7R2QJpfCubdrzMSN9jct9DqWEbt8lnf0HrRbwvWqnvtsluWV5GW4VZb-/pub?gid=653426766&single=true&output=csv"

# importing the data
logged_data <- read_csv(csv_file)

latest_data <- logged_data %>%
  rename(time_recorded = 1,
         yt_link = 2,
         video_name = 3,
         channel_name = 4,
         duration_s = 5,
         views = 6,
         simul_activity = 7,
         finished_video = 8,
         rating = 9)

```

### Here's a cool graph comparing video enjoyment to their completion.

```{r fig.width = 14, fig.height = 6}
# creating the first plot
ggplot(data = latest_data) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = rating, fill = finished_video)) +
  labs(title = "Finished videos are better videos?",
       subtitle = "Comparing a video's rating to whether it was finished",
       caption = "Source: Emily Clelland's Google Form",
       x = "Number of videos",
       y = "Video rating")

```

How interesting.

### Here's another graph that analyses which activities are most often conducted while watching a YouTube video.

```{r fig.width = 14, fig.height = 6}
# naming and making informative the second plot that will be used
ggplot(data = latest_data) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = simul_activity),
           fill = "#ac84de") +
  labs(title = "Simultaneous activities while watching YouTube vidoes",
       subtitle = "Analysing which activities most frequently coincide with watching a YouTube video",
       caption = "Source: Emily Clelland's Google Form",
       x = "Activity",
       y = "Number of videos")

```

Woah, I never would have thought that was the most common activity.

### And what about this graph that shows the range of video durations in seconds. AND it's pink!

Wow, that's a big range of video lengths. There's 3600 seconds in an hour, to put it in perspective.

```{r fig.width = 14, fig.height = 6}
# naming and making informative the third plot that will be used
ggplot(data = latest_data) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = duration_s),
           fill = "#e086d2") +
  labs(title = "YouTube Video Duration",
       subtitle = "Examining the length of YouTube videos",
       caption = "Source: Emily Clelland's Google Form",
       x = "Duration (in seconds)",
       y = "Number of videos")

```

What cool graphs, right? Now let's look at some cool summary values.

```{r}
# naming the first summary value
views_vector <- latest_data$views
average_views <- mean(views_vector) %>%
  round(0)

# naming the second summary value
duration_vector <- latest_data$duration_s
longest_duration <- max(duration_vector)

# naming the third summary value
title_vector <- latest_data$video_name
shortest_title <- min(nchar(title_vector))

#disable scientific notation
options(scipen = 999)
```

### Time for some interesting numbers

The average number of views across the videos is `r average_views`.

The longest video is `r longest_duration` seconds in duration.

The shortest title is `r shortest_title` characters in length.

### What cool numbers!
